# Keyboard Layouts
_A repository of my custom keyboard layouts._  

_Currently most layouts are only for Windows. Sorry!_  

## NEWS
**NEW LINUX KEYBOARD LAYOUT AVAILABLE FOR ENGLISH-IPA v14.2.**  
You can find it inside the [Layout - EN-UK - IPA / latest](https://github.com/fazzaan/keyboard-layouts/tree/main/Layout%20-%20EN-UK%20-%20IPA/latest) directory.  
I haven't yet made a Release, but feel free to check the code out and install it if you want.  
If you're using Linux, you'll wanna use the XKB version.  
I'll write a Release soon with info and a guide on how to install it. (It's pretty straightforward.)  

**This keyboard layout was made possible with the [KLFC project](https://github.com/39aldo39/klfc) by [@39aldo39](https://github.com/39aldo39). Big thanks to them! 🙏**

I am transitioning to Linux right now, December 2025.  
To use Linux as my daily driver, I need keyboard layouts for my language teaching and other things.  
Watch this space -- I expect to release my various keyboard layouts for Linux in the next few days!

## Abjoid layout
_Windows_  
Abjoid is a conscript of my own, based on phonetics and visually inspired by Arabic.  
It is not a true abjad, hence the _-oid_ name.  
* _Abjoid_ is the name of the script;  
* _Abjang_ is the name of the orthographic usage of the script for English.
