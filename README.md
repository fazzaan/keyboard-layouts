# Keyboard Layouts
A repository of my custom keyboard layouts.  

_Currently all layouts are only for Windows._  

* **NewEng** keyboard layout — for typing in the new alphabet for English, NewEng.  
* **English + IPA** keyboard layout — regular QWERTY layout with IPA symbols accessible on the `Alt Gr` layer.
* **IPA Topographic** layout — only IPA symbols (for English), mapped by physical position in the mouth. Designed for futuristic keyboards with LED displays on each key, as this is a useful layout but is hard to memorise.
* **NewVin** keyboard layout — for typing in my new alphabet for Vietnamese, NewViet.
