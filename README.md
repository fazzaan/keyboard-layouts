# Keyboard Layouts
_A repository of my custom keyboard layouts._  

_Currently all layouts are only for Windows. Sorry!_  

| Keyboard layout |  | Download |
|---|---|---|
| **NewEng** keyboard layout | for typing in the new alphabet for English, NewEng. (This is _my_ NewEng, as someone else has already made another alphabet with the same name. Oops, sorry!) | [v7.2](https://github.com/fazzaan/keyboard-layouts/releases/tag/NEv7.2) |
| **English + IPA** keyboard layout | regular QWERTY layout with IPA symbols accessible on the `Alt Gr` layer. | [v13.0](https://github.com/fazzaan/keyboard-layouts/releases/tag/EngIPAv13) |
| **Abjoid conscript** keyboard layout | for typing in my conscript _Abjoid_, designed for systematic consonant awareness. Conceptually based on Arabic. | [M1 v6.0](https://github.com/fazzaan/abjoid-distribution/releases/tag/M1v6-Starter-Pack) |
| **IPA Topographic** layout | only IPA symbols (for English), mapped by physical position in the mouth. Designed for futuristic keyboards with LED displays on each key, as this is a useful layout but is hard to memorise. | [v1.1](https://github.com/fazzaan/keyboard-layouts/releases/tag/TopoIPAv1.1) | 
| **NewVin** keyboard layout | _[Project suspended]_ - for typing in my new alphabet for Vietnamese, NewViet. | n/a |

# Abjoid layout
* Abjoid is a conscript of my own, based on phonetics and visually inspired by Arabic.
* It is not a true abjad, hence the _-oid_ name.
* _Abjoid_ is the name of the script; _Abjang_ is the name of the orthographic usage of the script for English.
