# About Abjoid 
* Abjoid is a conscript of my own, based on phonetics and visually inspired by Arabic.
* It is not a true abjad, hence the _-oid_ name.
* Abjoid works well for consonantal relationships. English consonants change sound often, so it is not suitable for the standard English orthography.
* Abjoid vowels are currently limited, and their presentation matches my personal analysis of my personal English dialect.
* _Abjoid_ is the name of the script; _Abjang_ is the name of the orthographic usage of the script for English.
* Abjoid works best for English when it is used as Abjang on top of my NewEng orthographic system.
* [Latest release, version M1 v6.0 (_M1v6_)](https://github.com/fazzaan/abjoid-distribution/releases/tag/M1v6-Starter-Pack)
