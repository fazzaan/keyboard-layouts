# Layout - EN-UK - NewEng

* [Latest release, version 7.2](https://github.com/fazzaan/keyboard-layouts/releases/tag/NEv7.2)
* [Repository - NewEng Script distribution](https://github.com/fazzaan/neweng-distribution)  

_Discourse on development of the keyboard layout, to fit the standard QWERTY construct._  

_Repurposes the number row for 11 of the 15 new letters._  

_The details on this page have not been udpated properly in several months. Information is certainly out of date._  
_A more up-to-date site can be found on my gitbook website, [lang.gitbook.io](https://lang.gitbook.io/)._

### Note on glyphs ȝ ȣ ꝏ ʞ
* _The current standard glyphs for ꝏ and ȣ are too wide and too tall respectively; new NewEng fonts will feature modified glyphs to regulate these vowel glyphs into the normal vowel space (width, and x-height)._  
* _Codepoints for Ʞ and ʞ may not feature correctly as true letters in some text editors, such as Microsoft Word._
* _Yogh **ȝ** is in this alphabet; ezh **ʒ** is_ not. _Many modern fonts render these two glyphs identically, which is incorrect. NewEng fonts are preferred to display yogh with two curved bowl shapes, to prevent accidental parsing as ezh **ʒ ⟨zh⟩ /ʒ/**, although ezh is not in this alphabet so distinction is not necessary. Stylistic fonts may choose to graph yogh **ȝ** like ezh **ʒ**._

# Notes on usage of NewEng keyboard layout
7th August 2025

 <summary>expand</summary>

## Recent changes (7th August 2025)
* All caron diacritics *for consonants* have been replaced with overdot diacritics.  
  * This is to reflect the orthographic updates in NewEng.
  * As the caron's effect is widespread throughout English phonology, a smaller and more visually appealing diacritic has been chosen to replace the caron:  
    * š → ṡ  ž → ż  
    * x̌ → ẋ  ẍ̌ → ẍ̇  
    * ť → ṫ  ď → ḋ  
    * ç̌ → ç̇  ǧ → ġ  
    * ч̌ → ч̇  ʞ̌ → ʞ̇   
  * The caron diacritic modifier is still accessible via AltGr+V, as in all previous layout versions. This is because the caron is still used on vowels to indicate that they are unaffected by a proceeding letter R. In effect, the caron protects the vowel sound such that it retains the same sound as its default value.  
    * worry → wury → wǒry  
    * current → cǔrent  
    * borrow → bǒrōw  
    * carry → cǎry

### Caps Lock
* Numbers of the NumRow are now accessible via AltGr + Caps Lock! 
  * This allows for easier input of multiple numbers. 
  * You still need to use AltGr at the same time, but this is a necessary sacrifice in order to be able to place the additional NewEng letters on the keyboard as primary citizens.  


## Reminders
* You can type the tilde diacritic with AltGr+Shift+' (useful for ñ and j̃).  
* Hwair ⟨Ƕƕ⟩ is available on both ` and AltGr+W.  
* Ẍ is used for voiced X in words like "exam".  
* Ç̇ is available for the rare assimilated sibilant ⟨c⟩, in words like "ocean".
  * The singular instance of voiced ⟨c⟩ is in the word "coercion", and can be transcribed somewhat horribly as ⟨cōérç̇̈ion⟩, where the diaeresis is used to add voicing to consonants.  
* ⟨E⟩ as /ɪ/ is spelled ⟨Ė⟩ and is available on AltGr+i. Placement on the E key seems more sensible, but AltGr+E is in use for the grave-marked Silent E. 
  * In a future phase of NewEng, Silent E may well be phased out entirely, but for now, there are instances in which keeping it is beneficial.  
  * The grave diacritic is for silencing any letter. _True_ silent letters have not been deleted from NewEng because they often serve etymological purposes, as well as providing visual distinction between otherwise homographs. You are encouraged to use the grave diacritic on silent letters, such as:  
    * k̀nōw k̀nē k̀nīf k̀nīȝt k̀nǒwlėġ g̀nōsis
    * deb̀t daŭb̀t
    * rėçëp̀t
    * p̀sȳʞóloġy
    * p̀nėumátic
    * etc.


## Information
### NewEng Letters
* 11 NewEng letters are on the number row.  
* Æ is on AltGr+A.  
* Œ is on AltGr+Y.  
* Ç is on AltGr+C.  
* Ç is also on ;.  
* Ç̇ is on AltGr+F.  
* И is on AltGr+N.  

### Symbols and Numbers
* Symbols are on the third layer, with AltGr (Ctrl+Alt).  
* Numbers are on the fourth layer, with AltGr+Shift AND AltGr+Caps Lock.  
* A NumPad is recommended for simpler & quicker input of numbers.

### Cómon Tȳpiŋ Sēquençėz ###

#### Can be stressed:####
ṓ yes  
ố yes  
o̊́ yes  
ö́ yes  
ắ and ĕ́ yes, other vowels no  
ȯ́ yes  
ok sō ðey can ål bē stresd.  


* `ṓ` = `vowel` + `]` + `[`  
* `ố` = `vowel` + `~` + `[`  
* `o̊́` = `vowel` + `}` + `[` 
* `ö́` = `vowel` + `b` + `[`  
* `ŏ́` = `vowel` + `#` + `[`  
* `ȯ́` = `vowel` + `{` + `[`  

## Later plans ##

* X iz rărly ūzd, ƕīl Ç iz ūzd a lot: consídr swopiŋ X and Ç (;), ǻlsō Ç wȣld bē nērer S, C and Z.
* Ǻtomāt tōn markiŋ and/or aláw ínpŭt līk VNese Télex.
