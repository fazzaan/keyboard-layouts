# For XKB layouts on Linux

Don't use the "install-system.sh" script, because this will install it into your root operating system.  

Just install them manually into your home .config folder:  

* Go to ~/.config/

* Create xkb folder

* Inside, create symbols folder and rules folder

* Copy the layout file from this github symbols folder into your symbols folder

* In the rules folder, create or update the evdev.xml file.  
You can find info online about how to do that, or wait a bit and I'll add a guide to the main page.
